## Install Ceph deployment

## Background
[Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/start/intro/) can be installed in commodity hardware and can provide scalable Object Storage, Block Storage and Filesystem. For ACM Observability, we only focus on Object Storage. Object Storage. [Ceph Object Gateway](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/) is an object storage interface built on top of librados to provide applications with a RESTful gateway to Ceph Storage Clusters. Ceph Object Storage supports two interfaces:
- S3-compatible: Provides object storage functionality with an interface that is compatible with a large subset of the Amazon S3 RESTful API.

- Swift-compatible: Provides object storage functionality with an interface that is compatible with a large subset of the OpenStack Swift API.

For ACM Observability feature, we are only interested in S3-compatible interface.

## Our Goal
- We will lay down one way to create Ceph Cluster on a Kubernetes cluster using the [Rook Operator](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v0.9/ceph-object.html). 
- And then we will create a Object Store and a Bucket. 
- And finally generate the Configuration needed for ACM Observability to access the Object Store/Bucket created using S3 API.

For this, the sample code we provided relied on this [Red Hat Blog](https://medium.com/@karansingh010/rook-ceph-deployment-on-openshift-4-2b34dfb6a442) . 

`This sample relies on a older version of Rook, v0.9 and we have tested this on OpenShift 4.3 only.`

### Create the security context constraints

```
$ cd example/ceph/
$ oc apply -f scc.yaml --validate=false
```

### Deploy the rook operator

```
$ oc create -f operator.yaml
$ oc get pods -n rook-ceph-system

```

### Verify your Ceph cluster

```
$ oc create -f toolbox.yaml
$ oc  -n rook-ceph exec -it rook-ceph-tools bash
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# ceph -s
  cluster:
    id:     fd0a79e6-2332-42e9-a57b-f32153c7ffed
    health: HEALTH_OK

  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum c,b,a
    mgr: a(active)
    osd: 6 osds: 6 up, 6 in
    rgw: 1 daemon active

  data:
    pools:   6 pools, 600 pgs
    objects: 339  objects, 223 MiB
    usage:   265 GiB used, 452 GiB / 717 GiB avail
    pgs:     600 active+clean
```

### Accessing S3 object storage
Now we will create the object store, which starts the RGW service in the cluster with the S3 API using the object.yaml and confirm that it is created.

```
$ oc create -f object.yaml
$ oc get pod -l app=rook-ceph-rgw -n rook-ceph

```
Please wait for the RGW pod to be up before we proceed to the next step. 

### Create a Object Store User
Now we will create the object store user, which calls the RGW service in the cluster with the S3 API using the object-user.yaml

```
$ oc create -f object-user.yaml
$ oc describe secret -n rook-ceph rook-ceph-object-user-object-object
Name:         rook-ceph-object-user-object-object
Namespace:    rook-ceph
Labels:       app=rook-ceph-rgw
              rook_cluster=rook-ceph
              rook_object_store=object
              user=object
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  kubernetes.io/rook

Data
====
AccessKey:  20 bytes
SecretKey:  40 bytes

```

- We can retrieve the S3 access key (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) value as below

```
$ ACCESS_KEY=$(oc -n rook-ceph get secret rook-ceph-object-user-object-object -o yaml | grep AccessKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)
$ echo $ACCESS_KEY
CDDQ0YU1C4A77A0GE54S
```

- We can retrieve the S3 secret access key (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) as below

```
$ SECRET_KEY=$(oc -n rook-ceph get secret rook-ceph-object-user-object-object -o yaml | grep SecretKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)
$ echo $SECRET_KEY
awkEbItAs6OXsbOC6Qk7SX45h01GSw51z9SDasBI
```

### Expose Object Store externally
Create a route to expose the RGW service. This will be called the `endpoint` below.

```
$ oc -n rook-ceph expose svc/rook-ceph-rgw-object
$ oc -n rook-ceph get route | awk '{ print  $2 }'
HOST/PORT
rook-ceph-rgw-object-rook-ceph.apps.acm-hub.dev05.red-chesterfield.com
```

### Create a S3 Bucket in the Store
We will use a S3 compatible client to create a bucket in the object store. Luckily this client is provided in the toolbox installed earlier. 

Log into the toolbox container created earlier

```
oc  -n rook-ceph exec -it rook-ceph-tools                               

```
Set up environment varibles as below
AWS_HOST: `rook-ceph-rgw-object:8081` as per this example.
AWS_ENDPOINT: `oc get service rook-ceph-rgw-object -n rook-ceph` and use `CLUSTER-IP:PORT`

```
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=CDDQ0YU1C4A77A0GE54S
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=awkEbItAs6OXsbOC6Qk7SX45h01GSw51z9SDasBI
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# export AWS_HOST=rook-ceph-rgw-object:8081
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# export AWS_ENDPOINT=172.30.162.20:8081
```

Creating a bucket called `thanos-acm` now
```
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# s3cmd mb --no-ssl --host=${AWS_HOST} --host-bucket=  s3://thanos-acm
Bucket 's3://thanos-acm/' created
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# s3cmd ls --no-ssl --host=${AWS_HOST}
2020-09-14 23:42  s3://thanos-acm
[root@rook-ceph-tools /]# exit
exit

```

### Configuration for ACM Observability

Your object storage configuration should as following:

```
type: s3
config:
  bucket: thanos-acm
  endpoint: rook-ceph-rgw-object-rook-ceph.apps.acm-hub.dev05.red-chesterfield.com
  insecure: true
  access_key: CDDQ0YU1C4A77A0GE54S
  secret_key: awkEbItAs6OXsbOC6Qk7SX45h01GSw51z9SDasBI
```

### Proceed with installation of ACM Observbility
Then you can be following these steps to deploy multicluster-observability-operator: https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-monitoring-operator#install-this-operator-on-rhacm
