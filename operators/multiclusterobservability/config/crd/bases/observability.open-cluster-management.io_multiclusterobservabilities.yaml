                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless

                                Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                            not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                      recursively.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait

                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
                                first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
                                at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
                                flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.

                                    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                    API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.
